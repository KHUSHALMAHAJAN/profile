                <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system programming, such as developing operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems, due to its efficiency and close interaction with hardware. C provides low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and a rich set of operators, making it highly flexible and powerful. It also serves as the foundation for many modern programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python, making it an essential language to learn for software developers</p>

            <div class="elem elemlp">
                <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an extension of the C language. It introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, making it well-suited for developing complex software systems, such as games, operating systems, and applications requiring high performance. C++ maintains the efficiency and low-level capabilities of C while providing advanced features for abstraction and code reusability, making it a versatile language for both system-level and application-level programming.</p>

                <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, designed to be platform-independent with its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute code, making it highly portable across different operating systems. Java's robust libraries, strong security features, and scalability make it ideal for building a wide range of applications, from desktop and mobile applications to enterprise-level systems and web applications. Its simplicity, reliability, and widespread use have made Java one of the most popular programming languages worldwide</p>

                <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the foundation for web pages by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and multimedia. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to organize and present information, ensuring it is readable by browsers. It works in conjunction with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build dynamic and visually appealing websites, making it an essential skill for web development.</p>

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the visual presentation of HTML elements on a webpage. It allows developers to define styles such as colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsiveness, ensuring the website looks attractive and user-friendly across various devices. By separating content (HTML) from design (CSS), it enables easier maintenance and consistency across web pages. CSS also supports advanced features like animations and transitions, making it an essential tool for modern web development.</p>

                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, lightweight programming language primarily used to add interactivity, functionality, and dynamic behavior to websites. It enables developers to create features such as animations, form validation, interactive maps, and real-time content updates. JavaScript runs directly in the browser, making it essential for creating responsive and engaging user interfaces. With the introduction of frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js, JavaScript has expanded beyond web browsers, allowing developers to build server-side applications, mobile apps, and more, making it one of the most versatile programming languages.</p>
